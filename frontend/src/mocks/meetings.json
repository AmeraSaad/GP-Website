      "extracted_requirements": "**Interface Components:**\n\n* **Audio Timeline Display:** A visual representation of the audio timeline, likely using a waveform visualization.  Should display section markers clearly and allow for zooming and navigation.  (Inferred)\n* **Bleeping Tool:**  An interface element for selecting and applying bleeps to sections of the audio timeline. This could involve a selection tool, a \"bleep\" button, and potentially a preview function. (Inferred)\n* **Section Management Panel:**  A panel for managing the sections within the timeline, including adding, deleting, editing IDs, and referencing other sections.  (Inferred)\n* **Metadata Input Fields:** Fields for inputting optional metadata such as accuracy and timestamps.  (Inferred)\n* **Data Import/Export Functionality:** Interface components for importing and exporting audio data and associated metadata in the defined XML format. (Inferred)\n\n\n**User Flows:**\n\n* **Bleeping Audio:** User selects a portion of the audio timeline using the bleeping tool and applies the bleep effect.  (Inferred)\n* **Creating Sections:** User defines sections within the timeline, assigns unique IDs, and establishes references between sections using the Section Management Panel. (Inferred)\n* **Adding Metadata:**  User inputs optional metadata such as accuracy and timestamps using the provided input fields. (Inferred)\n* **Importing/Exporting Data:** User imports and exports audio data and associated metadata in the defined XML format. (Inferred)\n\n\n**Visual Design:**\n\n* _No specific visual design requirements are provided in the text._ Further elicitation is required to determine branding, color schemes, typography, and overall visual style.\n\n**Accessibility:**\n\n* _No specific accessibility requirements are mentioned._  However, accessibility should be considered for users with disabilities, potentially including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast.\n\n**Responsive Design:**\n\n* _No specific responsive design requirements are mentioned._  Consideration should be given to how the interface adapts to different screen sizes and devices.\n\n\n**User Interaction:**\n\n* **Intuitive Timeline Manipulation:**  The audio timeline display should allow for intuitive zooming, panning, and selection of audio segments. (Inferred)\n* **Clear Feedback Mechanisms:**  The system should provide clear visual and/or auditory feedback to user actions, such as confirming the application of a bleep or the successful creation of a section. (Inferred)\n* **Efficient Workflow for Section Management:**  The section management panel should provide an efficient workflow for creating, editing, and referencing sections within the timeline. (Inferred)\n\n\nIt's crucial to note that many of these UI/UX requirements are inferred based on the functional requirements.  Further requirements gathering and user research would be essential in a real-world project to fully define the user interface and user experience.",
