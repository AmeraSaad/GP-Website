    "summary_text": "The team discussed implementing a new user authentication system. They mentioned that it should support OAuth, multi-factor authentication, and traditional username/password login. Security was a major concern, and they emphasized encryption of user data. Additionally, the system must integrate with existing databases and allow role-based access control. A deadline was set for the end of Q2.",

    "requirements": "Based on the provided functional and non-functional requirements, The UI must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).\n* **Fluid Layout:**  The layout should adjust dynamically to fit different screen sizes and orientations.\n\n\n**User Interaction:**\n\n* **Intuitive Interactions:**  User interactions should be intuitive and easy to understand.  This requires careful consideration of interaction design principles and user testing.\n* **Clear Feedback Mechanisms:**  The system should provide clear feedback to the user's actions, such as loading indicators, confirmation messages, and error messages.\n* **Error Prevention:**  The UI should be designed to prevent errors, such as input validation and clear instructions.\n\n\nThis detailed breakdown provides a more comprehensive set of UI/UX requirements compared to simply listing components and flows.  It highlights the need for further elaboration and user research to fully define the UI/UX design.",
    "srs_document": "# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\n**1.1 Purpose**\n\nThis document outlines the software requirements for a new authentication and authorization system.  It serves as a guide for developers, testers, and stakeholders involved in the design, development, and implementation of the system.  This SRS will define the functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring a shared understanding of the project's scope and goals.\n\n\n**1.2 Document Conventions**\n\n* **Acronyms:**  MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), OAuth (Open Authorization), WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), SRS (Software Requirements Specification), API (Application Programming Interface), UI (User Interface), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).\n* **Formatting:**  Requirements are identified using a consistent numbering scheme (e.g., FR-001).  Tables are used to organize requirements and their attributes.  UML diagrams (where applicable) \n\n**3.2.7 Accessibility Requirements**\n\n* AR-001: The system shall meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.\n* AR-002: The system shall be compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies.\n\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThis SRS document provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for the authentication and authorization system.  Further details and specifications will be elaborated in subsequent design documents.  This document serves as a living document and will be updated as the project progresses.",

    "ui_specifications": "The Login Screen features a simple vertical layout containing username and  Button.  The placement is usually prominent, at the top or bottom of the screen.\n\nPages for Forgot Password, OAuth Integration, and Multi-Factor Authentication reuse components from the Login Screen, adapting elements and labels to their respective functionalities.  Their view hierarchies are similar to the Login Screen.  The remaining items (Role-Based Access Control, Branding Consistency, Clear Visual Hierarchy, Consistent Design Language, WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance, Keyboard Navigation, Screen Reader Compatibility, Multi-Device Support, and Fluid Layout) are design principles or accessibility considerations, not individual UI elements, and therefore lack a view hierarchy."
