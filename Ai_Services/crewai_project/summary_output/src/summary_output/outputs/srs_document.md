* **Acronyms:** Acronyms will be defined upon first use and listed in the glossary (Section 1.5).
* **Formatting:**  Requirements will be presented using numbered lists and tables where appropriate.  UML diagrams may be used to illustrate complex interactions (not included in this example).

**1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions**

* **Developers:** This document provides the complete specification for the software, guiding the design and implementation process.  Focus on Sections 3 (System Features and Requirements) and the appendices.
* **Testers:** This document defines the acceptance criteria for testing.  Focus on Sections 3 (System Features and Requirements) and the non-functional requirements in Section 3.3.
* **Stakeholders:** This document provides a high-level overview of the system's capabilities and constraints.  Focus on Sections 1 (Introduction) and 2 (Overall Description).

**1.4 Product Scope**

This document specifies the requirements for a data management and reporting system designed to allow users to upload, manage, analyze, and generate reports from their data. The system will provide features for user management, secure data handling, and customizable reporting options.  The primary objective is to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for data analysis and reporting.

The system will provide the following key functionalities:

* User Account Management
* Data File Upload and Management
* Data Search and Filtering
* Report Generation and Customization
* Secure Data Handling
* Audit Logging (for all user actions)


**2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**

* **Administrators:**  Full access to all system features, including user management, data administration, and audit log review.
* **End-Users:**  Access to data upload, management, reporting, search functionalities.  Limited access to audit logs (may only view their own actions).
* **Guests (Optional):**  Limited access, potentially only for viewing public reports.  No access to data upload or management.


**2.4 Operating Environment**

* **Hardware:**  Standard web server hardware with sufficient processing power and storage capacity (to be specified in system design document).
* **Software:**  Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, React,  Node.js (for frontend),  PostgreSQL (database)
* **Network:**  Reliable internet connection required for access.
* **Supported Platforms:**  Web-based application, compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  Specific versions to be defined in system design document.

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**

* **Technology Stack:** The chosen technology stack (Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL) may influence design choices and impose certain limitations on performance and scalability.
* **Security:**  The system must comply with relevant data security and privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA.

**2.6 User Documentation**

* User manual (PDF)
* Online help system integrated within the application
* FAQs section within the application


**2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies**

* The system will be developed using the specified technology stack (Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL).
* The system will be hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services).  Specific infrastructure details to be defined in system design document.
* The system will assume reliable internet connectivity for users.  Error handling for network issues will be implemented.
