        The GAMMA-J Web Store is a plug-and-play e-commerce solution designed to help small retailers quickly set up and manage online stores. 
        The system, delivered via a USB key, includes essential features such as customer account management, inventory control, shopping cart
        functionality, and secure order processing. 
        It supports multiple user roles‚Äîcustomers, sales personnel, and administrators‚Äîeach with tailored interfaces for browsing products,
        managing inventory, and overseeing system operations. Security is a priority, with HTTPS encryption, fraud detection, and automated backups to protect sensitive data.
        The platform is built on Slackware Linux, Apache, and MySQL, ensuring compatibility with older browsers like Internet Explorer 6/7 and Netscape.

        Key strengths include high availability (99.99%), fast performance (e.g., <1s search times), and a plug-in API for future expansions. 
        However, challenges remain, such as transitioning from phone orders to the digital system and integrating advanced shipping and analytics features.
        Designed for portability and ease of use, the GAMMA-J
        Web Store provides a cost-effective, scalable solution for small businesses entering e-commerce, with room for growth through modular enhancements.
